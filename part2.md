# Part II - How long do World Bank retirees live?
The first that comes to mind is that having an empirical distribution that is not symmetrical means that the average may not be the best statistic to use because it can be shifted towards extreme or outlier values. It is more appropriate to use a robust statistic like the median, which in this case is likely to be around 84-86, rather than the mean value of 81 years old. 

Additionally, analyzing the overall distribution and comparing it to life expectancy by gender can lead to the Simpson's paradox, where trends that appear in separate groups (in this case, males and females) can disappear or reverse when combined. To avoid this, it's better to have separate empirical distributions for males and females if we want to conclude based on gender.

It is also not clear why we are comparing the “retiree age at death” with the life expectancy of people at 65 years old today. Where does this 65 come from? Is it because the average age of WB staff is 65? What about the average age by gender? This is important to clarify in order to get accurate conclusions. Furthermore, WB staff come from countries all around the world, so we have to consider in the analysis variables such as genetics, environmental factors, life-style, among other variables that are related with life expectancy.

Lastly, it is interesting to read that “it is no impressive” to see that the mean is around 81 years old without explaining the reason why. Was there a health policy inside the WB that make staff live longer? Are there external factors inside the office that results in health benefits? Is the WB promoting physical activity or healthy habits to make its staff live longer? Having this information at hand could help formulate better questions and search for more meaningful answers through data analysis.
